This repository provides an implementation of the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) using the interpret library to build interpretable machine learning models. The example demonstrates how to create a synthetic dataset with features such as "Age" and "Income", and then use EBM to predict an outcome variable. The code includes training a model, evaluating its accuracy, and visualizing the global explainability of the model's predictions. This project is ideal for those looking to explore transparent, interpretable models while still achieving strong predictive performance.

Key Features:
Create a synthetic dataset with continuous features.
Train an Explainable Boosting Classifier (EBM) using the interpret library.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy.
Visualize the global explanation of the model's predictions for better interpretability.
